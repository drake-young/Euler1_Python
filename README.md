# Euler1_Python

Problem 1 of project Euler solved using three separate approaches in Python3. Once using iteration over all integers 0-1000, once using iteration over only multiples of 3 and 5, and once using summation of the results of a generator function. All three results are equivalent and the runtime are displayed upon execution.

## Project Euler Problem 1 -- Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
